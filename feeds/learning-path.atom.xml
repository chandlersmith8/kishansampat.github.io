To begin with, Python and a text editor should suffice. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of text editors out there, and one could get easily confused with the choices available. I reached out to some of my colleagues for recommendations; &lt;a href="https://code.sublimetext.com"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be the general recommendations for beginners. Note that for Windows, you can download the .exe installation files, however, for Ubuntu, you can install them directly via the terminal using sudo commands. You can simply search on Google and you&amp;#8217;d be able to find tons of instructions out there on how to do this. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Python, Ubuntu already comes with a version of Python installed, however, it is best to have the latest one installed. I&amp;#8217;d recommend installing it in a Virtual Environment within your working folders. I&amp;#8217;ll come to that a bit later, once we&amp;#8217;ve started working on some code.&amp;nbsp;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Learning Path"></category><category term="environment readiness"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting up your environment</title><link href="https://kishansampat.github.io/env-setup.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-18T22:07:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-05-18T22:07:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Kishan Sampat</name></author><id>tag:kishansampat.github.io,2020-05-18:/env-setup.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Setting up the local enviroment on your&amp;nbsp;computer&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a Windows 10 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;500GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt; Hard Disk. I was keen to initally try setting up my environment in Windows, however, I faced a number of errors just trying to get Python installed. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is not impossible to get your environment set up on Windows, as a beginner, I decided to go with a VirtualBox setup and installed Ubuntu in it. My &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; has enough processing power, and it was proving to be a significant overhead to try and get Python installed; I thought it was better to go with an Ubuntu setup as I also found instructions on the web much easier to follow for Ubuntu. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed VirtualBox and gave it about half of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; (around &lt;span class="caps"&gt;8GB&lt;/span&gt;), and about 100 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; of hard drive space. While &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; should be enough for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, I decided to give it more power as I anticipate running heavy queries in the future. And with that, we&amp;#8217;re good to kick off our&amp;nbsp;learning!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Learning Path"></category><category term="environment setup"></category></entry></feed>
